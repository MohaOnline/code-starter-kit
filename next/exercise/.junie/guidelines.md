- This project is a Next JS 15 project. Ensure that the generated code runs correctly under Next JS 15.
- All pages or codes requested to be generated under `src/app/examples/`, `pages/pages/examples/` folders are considered as Sample / Example pages.  Users request code generation in this directory to explore technologies or new features, so generated code does not need to follow existing code style or design patterns; instead, follow official documentation recommendations or best practices.
- All requests related to `pages/pages/examples/`, `src/app/examples` folders needn't refer to existing functions except invoking API when accessing DB or 3rd part API.
- While libraries are missing, prompt user to execute or issue command `deno install [library-name] --allow-scripts` instead of `npm install [library-name]`. This project use `deno` to manage libraries. LLMs may refer to `deno` official documents to understand how to do this.
- Add enough comments to codes with Simplified Chinese and English (Multi-Language) to help LLMs, developers understand the design logic, technical background information and how codes work.
