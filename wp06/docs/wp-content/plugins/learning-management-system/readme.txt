* **Sell Courses:** Besides creating online courses, selling them should also be as easy as anything else. That's why we have our own inbuilt order system, so you don't need to go through the hassle of installing a separate eCommerce plugin to sell your courses. Masteriyo supports both PayPal and offline payment out of the box.

* **Setup Wizard:** Setting up Masteriyo LMS plugin on your WordPress site is just a walk in a park. A minimal learning curve means more time to manage and focus on what you are good at.

* **Clean User Interface, Well-designed, and Modern Course Builder:** Masteriyo LMS is a modern course builder plugin that is unique, well-thought, and beautifully designed. It comes with a clean and minimalistic interface that pleases your eyes.

* **Interactive Learning Page:** A Learning page denotes the pages where students interact with the courses after enrollment. We've focused on making the learning page as smooth as silk for a better learning experience with Masteriyo powered by React JS. So, the learning page looks excellent in terms of both design and functionality.

* **Interactive Learning Page Header:** The header in the learning page comprises the site logo to return to the homepage of the site, course informative progress bar, and the student account.

* **Course Progressive Bar:** Interactive learning page comes with a dynamic course progressive bar at the top that helps students locate at which step of the course curriculum they are at. It provides students with ideas about the part of the course they've completed and the remaining parts that are yet to be completed. This percentage meter also encourages them to complete the course.

* **Learning Page Course Navigation:** You'll also find a vertical navigation section for courses at the left side of the learning page. It helps you navigate through all the sections, lessons, and quizzes of the course curriculum.

* **Distraction-Free Learning Page:** We strongly believe that students should be able to focus on their courses entirely. And that's why we have put our utmost effort into making the learning page free of any distractions. The page is independent of your site design and based on React JS for a better learning experience. Additionally, students also get the complete freedom to hide the header and navigation section of the learning page if they want to.

* **Questions and Answers in Learning Page:** Taking courses becomes more fun and effective if students interact better with the instructor and other fellow students. That's precisely why we have a dedicated section for questions and answers on the learning page.

* **Students Account Page:** Masteriyo LMS comes with a beautiful student account page from where every student can get a quick overview of the courses they have enrolled in or purchased. They can also edit other information related to their account.

### What our user says:

* "I am extremely satisfied with the Masteriyo plugin for its Pro features : content dripping and prerequisite, which have allowed me to create professional online courses. However, I would love for the plugin to also offer an ultimate feature that would allow users to subscribe globally and access all courses without having to make payments for each individual course. If this were added, it would be a fantastic addition to make this plugin even more useful and user-friendly." - By [eyescream49](https://profiles.wordpress.org/eyescream49/)

* "This is my first LMS plugin. At the beginning I have more problems, but all of them were solved with the kind costumer service. For me, with a small webshop and with my first online course, it's awesome. Easy to handle, and if I have any question they answer me soon. I recommended it to everybody who need a great LMS with a great support!" - By [fityircvagyok](https://profiles.wordpress.org/fityircvagyok/)
