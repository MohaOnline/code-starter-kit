### Are you selling to Chinese customers?
This is the **perfect** plugin for business owners or entrepreneurs who want to accept WeChat Pay or Alipay payments from Chinese customers. 

Stripe.com supports WeChat Pay and Alipay payments, meaning you don’t have to set up a WeChat Official Account or register your business in China in order to accept WeChat Pay. Now, you can easily charge Chinese consumers using a payment method familiar to them and then have the funds deposited into your domestic bank account associated with Stripe. Simple and easy! 

### WeChat Pay, Alipay & Credit Card Payments Work Seamlessly

#### Desktop UX:
* WeChat Pay generates a QR code for the end-user to scan using their mobile device
* Alipay payments redirect the user to Alipay’s website, which displays a QR code for the same mobile payment process or to login to the user's Alipay account, then automatically redirects the end-user back to your selected thank you page upon payment completion
* Users are redirected to the Thank You page

#### Mobile UX:
* WeChat users must generate the code on another device and scan it with their WeChat app. A notification pops up on the form notifying them to do this.
* Alipay users are redirected to the corresponding payment website on their mobile browsers to complete payment. 
* Users are redirected to the Thank You page

### Please note

* You must have a verified Stripe.com account in a [supported Stripe country](https://stripe.com/global/ "Stripe Supported Country List") to use this plugin.  

* Alipay and WeChat payments can only be accepted from Alipay and WeChat accounts that have been identity verified. Stripe cannot presently accept payments from unverified Alipay and WeChat accounts, but this may be subject to change. 

* WeChat Pay supports one-time payments from Chinese customers.

* Alipay supports one-time payments from Chinese customers out of the box. Recurring payments can be enabled by Stripe and require customization by our team in the plugin. Contact us to get recurring Alipay payments set up. 

* China Payments Plugin requires you to Connect your Stripe account in order to function properly for TEST or LIVE payments. 

* If you have any problems or need installation support, we kindly request you please [contact us](https://chinapaymentsplugin.com/support/) for support BEFORE leaving negative feedback. We will do our best to resolve your issue or use your feedback to improve future releases.
